# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the Github Flow. 

By completing this tutorial, I've learnt how to create a project and make a pull request on GitHub.

As part of that, I've learned how to:

- Create a repository.
- Start and manage a new branch.
- Change a file and commit those changes to GitHub.
- Open and merge a pull request.
